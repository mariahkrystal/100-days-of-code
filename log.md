### Day 1: July 09 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked on my personal website. Tweaked it a little, decluttered. 

**Thoughts:** I've been slacking on my web dev bootcamp class on udemy. I just love adding new things to my site, I can't help it lol

### Day 1: July 10 2019

**Today's Progress**: Worked on my personal website. Changed my landing page, i'm still not sure if i like it or not. 

**Thoughts:** I really need to get back to my udemy class but I just can't get motivate. Thinking about buying a .com domain to start a personal blog. I keep finding ways to distract myself from finishing that class, smh.
